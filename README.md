# bank-customer-churn-prediction
Bank Customer Churn Prediction End to End Project.
🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning models. The goal is to analyze customer behavior, preprocess data, and compare multiple models to determine the best-performing one for churn prediction. This workflow includes:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw customer data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding patterns and relationships in the dataset.

Model Training & Evaluation: Training Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, SVM, Neural Networks, and KNN models.

Model Comparison & Assessment: Evaluating and ranking models based on performance metrics.
